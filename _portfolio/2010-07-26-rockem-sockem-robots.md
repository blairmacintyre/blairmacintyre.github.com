Aura Interactive (the AR Games company I co-founded in 2009) created a prototype Augmented Reality game based on the classic toy Rock’em Sock’em robots, in collaboration with Qualcomm and Mattel. The prototype was used as a demo during the announcement of Qualcomm’s AR SDK at Uplinq, July 2010.

Here is a video of the game, produced by Mattel for the Uplinq conference.
