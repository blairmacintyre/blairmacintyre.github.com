The Real-World Wide Web was a project we did in back in 2000 that explored how to integrate the World Wide Wide with the physical world using AR.  At the time, we focused on leveraging "up and coming" concepts like the semantic web and custom geo-based search engines to expose structured web content into the world.  This project was an early inspriation for our Argon project.
