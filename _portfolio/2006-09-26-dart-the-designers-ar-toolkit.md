The [Designers Augmented Reality Toolkit](http://ael.gatech.edu/dart) is a set of software tools that support rapid design and implementation of augmented reality experiences and applications. DART is designed to facilitate the complete design and development process, from initial concept through experience and content testing to final product delivery.  DART empasizes rapid, informal content creation and early experience testing, promoting iterative design early in the creation process.  DART is built on top of Macromedia Director, bringing AR authoring to a wide range of designers. 

Our work on DART was motiviated by our interest in experiences for informal education, digital art, and entertainment.   However, DART can be used to create AR applications in any domain (including industrial, military and scientific applications), and is especially useful for rapid prototyping and exploration. Since DART supports the devices commonly used in Virtual Reality, DART can also be used to create VR experiences and applications.

DART is for anyone (both technical and non-technical designers, artists, and researchers) who wants to create AR experiences and applications. All development is done in the powerful Macromedia Director multimedia programming environment, using metaphors familiar to Director user.  Content creation is done with your preferred video-, and sound, and 3D editing programs; any content that can be important into Director can be used in DART.
