A project sponsored by NyNEX Science and Technology, exploring how to use AR to give a line-worker information about the connections in a phone terminal box (of the sort you'd see in the basement of an apartment building).  Work orders were labeled directly, as were pairs corresponding to problem reports and suggestions for periodic testing.

More information soon.
