In our Mixed Reality Experience Design class, one of the sites we often ask our students to base projects on is the historic _Sweet Auburn_ area of Atlanta.  Home to the Martin Luther King Center and the center of the African American community during the early years of the Civil Rights era, the area surrounding Auburn Ave in downtown Atlanta is rich with history.  In the class, we have the students look at how to use augmented reality to explore the history of this old and important area.  Students have recreated old building, highlighted the importance of remaining sites, and created fictional historic &#8220;situated&#8221; documentaries on the site.
