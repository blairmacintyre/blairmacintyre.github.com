My professional life has revolved around academia, research and consulting.  I am currently a professor at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu), in the [School of Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu).  After getting degrees at the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) (in Canada) and [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) (in New York City), I move to [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) in Atlanta.

As a student, I worked as an intern at research labs, including the Waterloo Systems Research Lab, the [Center for the New Oxford English Dictionary](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa/newoed-project.html), Xerox PARC and NYNEX Science and Technology&#8217;s Research Center.  I was a graduate student at both the University of Waterloo (in the [Computer Graphics Lab](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca)) and Columbia University (the [Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab](http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/)).

I have been at Georgia Tech since the beginning of 1999, where I created and run the GVU Center&#8217;s [Augmented Environments Lab](http://ael.gatech.edu/lab).  My research is in the area of &#8220;Augmented Reality&#8221;, an approach to creating interactive computer media where content is directly integrated into a participants experience of the world around them.  My research  has spanned a broad spectrum  of application domains over the years, from military and industrial applications, to art, entertainment, education and games.  I am an active member of the [GVU Center](http://www.gvu.gatech.edu), collaborating with colleagues throughout Georgia Tech.  Since many of my collaborations are with faculty in the [School of Literature, Media and Communication](http://www.lmc.gatech.edu), I am also an adjunct professor there.

In 2009, I co-founded [Aura Interactive](http://www.aurainteractive.com), a design and consulting firm specializing in Augmented Reality.  I have consulted for numerous companies, big and small, on design, gaming, business and legal issues related to AR.  At Aura, we are especially interested in helping push AR from a niche technology to the mainstream, and work with clients to ensure their applications and experiences make effective and compelling use of the technology.
