I'm Blair MacIntyre, a researcher and educator working at Georgia Tech, living in Atlanta, and running The MacMynatt Group consulting firm.  In my professional life, I'm interested in designing software to help non-geeks (i.e., people "not like me") create interactive experiences that appear to live around them in the physical world, and in exploring the potential of these experiences to change how we work, play and live.  These days, I'm particularly interested in using the web for augmented reality development.

This site contains an collection of the projects I've worked on over the years, along with information about my professional and personal life. The blog contains random collection articles and thoughts about AR, research and education that I've written over the years.
