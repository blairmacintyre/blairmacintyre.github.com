        <div><p>Over the last few months, I’ve talked to countless reporters, and answered questions via phone and email.  It occurred to me the other day that it might be good to start sharing some of these questions and answers here, so more people can see them;  if I’m going to the trouble to explain AR and my views on it, why never put those ideas out there?   So, without further ado, here are some current thoughts on AR.</p>

        <div><p>Looking back over the summer, it’s almost comical to re-read the sometimes-frenzied excitement at the possibility that the <a href="http://gamesalfresco.com/2009/07/14/has-augmented-reality-arrived-to-the-iphone/">iPhone will support AR</a> with OS 3.1.  The possibility was exciting, even to those of us not trying to keep a small company afloat;  the idea that there would finally be a platform that would let us get our ideas, games and products to millions of eager customers was an unfamiliar feeling for those of us who have been doing AR for a (very long) while. And for the dozen or so small AR companies, surviving on contract work for movies web sites and eye-candy web advertising, it must have been intoxicating.</p>

There’s been enough press about this, so I won’t go into details.  Vuzix had a demo of their two newest displays (the 920, with the camera attachment, and a not-yet-functional physical prototype of the Wrap, due out this summer).  Suffice to say, I believe these displays are marking a turning point for mobile AR.</p>
