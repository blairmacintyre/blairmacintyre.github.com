Well, I guess I'll answer that question with "no."   But, on the night before ISMAR starts here in Cambridge, England, I was sitting around with some fellow AR folk, having a pint and some fish and chips in The Eagle, and I let the unwashed iPhone-less masses indulge in Spore on my iPhone.

And it struck me as somehow appropriate that we were playing Spore in the Eagle Pub.   For those who don't know,  the Eagle is the place where Francis Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime on 28 February 1953 to announce that he and James Watson had "discovered the secret of life" after they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA. 

Perhaps this is only amusing to those of us with jet lag.  Off to bed, then, and off to ISMAR tomorrow!
