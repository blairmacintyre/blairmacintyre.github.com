Ori posted a video of the demos, over [on his blog](http://gamesalfresco.com/2009/03/26/gdc-2009-first-augmented-reality-demo-at-a-game-developer-conference/).  He called it the first AR demo at GDC, which I don't think is really true.  Sony must have demonstrated Eye of Judgement years ago, for example.  Plus, NVidia is demoing our game on their Tegra in their booth (so, we at least tied!).  :)

But, I don't think any of that is important.  The Metaio demos are nice, and it's good to see them combined with the Vuzix displays in the GDC expo!

Here's a direct link to the video Ori took:
