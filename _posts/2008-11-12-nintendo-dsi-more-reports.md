It looks like there are [more reports](http://mirror2image.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/nintendo-dsi-and-augmented-reality/) on the [DSi](http://kotaku.com/5057870/nintendo-announce-new-ds-the-nintendo-dsi) and it&#8217;s camera.  There is the potential for AR games here, but the big worry is that the device is too slow.  There are some [details/rumors on the hardware](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=274) floating around, but it&#8217;s not looking as promising as I&#8217;d like:  doing computer vision for any sort of tracking is expensive, and you still need to actually run the game!

That said, being able to do ANY AR on a commodity device will be awesome, as it will create an outlet for AR and drive people&#8217;s imagination.  And focusing on a kids device is key:  iPhone games are great when targeted at the > 20 year old set, but so many interesting AR games and &#8220;magic books&#8221; and so forth are targeted to much younger kids.  The iPhone isn&#8217;t going to be bouncing around in middle-school backpacks any time soon!
