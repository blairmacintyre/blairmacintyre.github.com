My super-awesome colleague [Trevor](https://trevor.smith.name/) raised the question  "Whatâ€™s a name for the web after we start supporting AR/VR headsets?"   He even posted the question to Twitter (you can go read responses there if you'd like, and chime in if you want).

It's a great question.  Some folks call it the 3D web, others like the Immersive Web.  Or the MetaVerse.  Cyberspace.

I read through some of the discussion (on twitter and elsewhere) and realized that one of the reasons I'm so enamored of [responsive design for the immersive web](https://blog.mozvr.com/progressive-webxr-ar-store/) (aside from the fact that my student [Gheric Spieginer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gspeiginer/) couches his work on the [Argon project](https://argonjs.io) this way) is that I strongly believe that the core feature of the web is that _**people get to choose what technology they use to browse the web, and good web pages should respond to their choice**_.

(If you don't know about [Lynx, a customizable text-based web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)), you should ... it was created in 1992 and is still being used and developed!)

So, to all you folks who are dreaming of a "Web" that's entirely 3D and unencumbered by all this legacy 2D content, [you're doing it wrong](http://www.slate.com/topics/y/you_re_doing_it_wrong.html).
