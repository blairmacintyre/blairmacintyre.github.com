These last few weeks seem to have been punctuated with music-related events that have made me more conscious of the power of music and had me listening a lot more closely. I've been listening to a lot more variety of music, too:  my Apple Music "Radio" channels including Black Eyed Peas, Avicii, Pink!, Bruce Springstein, The Dowco Triump Street Band (bagpipes), among other things.  

On April 20th, [Avicii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii) died at the age of 28.  I wasn't a huge fan, I barely knew of him, but I loved the song [Wake Me Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Me_Up_(Avicii_song)) and have found myself listening to more of his music this past few weeks.

Tonight, our family is going to see [Todrick Hall](http://todrickhall.com/) at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. Our daughter introduced the rest of us to Todrick, and we all fans now.  He's amazingly talented and creative. Here's the entire visual album he created for this tour, a simple but powerful story about a world where gender and racial norms are the reverse of ours.

His previous album (and tour, which we missed, sadly) was Straight Outta Oz, a remix of the Wizard of Oz he used to tell the story of his life and how he ended up where he is.  Here's the full visual album of it, it's also pretty amazing.

And the final music related event of this few weeks is that we just got tickets to go see [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)), one of the Korean Pop bands my kids love, in Newark in September.  I took my daughter to see SHINee last year in Dallas, and it was a blast.  I'm looking forward to it!  Here's the promo video for their tour.
