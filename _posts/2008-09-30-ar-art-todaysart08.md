I ran across at article about some amazing AR art at the [TodaysArt Festival](http://www.todaysart.nl/) when I stumbled on an article [here](http://www.psfk.com/2008/09/transforming-buildings-amazing-augmented-reality-video.html).  [Pablo Valbuena](http://www.pablovalbuena.com/) makes these very cool art pieces that appear to be created by careful projection onto architectural spaces.

It's exactly this kind of work that will push the field of AR forward, because it's compelling and not focused on the technology.  I am also a fan of [Julian Oliver's](http://julianoliver.com/) work, especially his Levelhead piece.
