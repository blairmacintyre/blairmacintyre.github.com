During a break at the [CHI workshop on Novel Interaction Techniques for Collaboration in VR](https://virtualreality-chi2018.media.mit.edu/), I was was chatting with [Ken Perlin](http://www.kenperlin.com/) about blogging. (Ken and I were both speaking;  my slides are web-based and available on [github](https://github.com/blairmacintyre/chi-arvr-workshop-2018/), by the way. Point our WebXR Viewer for iOS at the [github pages site for this repo](https://blairmacintyre.github.io/chi-arvr-workshop-2018/#/) and you'll even get some live, albeit simple, AR demos later in the talk.)

I've known Ken for years, and have always been amazed at the fact that he's [blogged every day for more than 10 years.](http://blog.kenperlin.com/)  Every single day.  So I asked him how he does it.  His answer: _**you just have to do it**_.  It just takes practice, and commitment, but it's not that hard.  

As often happens to people in these sorts of situations, I found myself trying to justify why I don't manage to do it. And I realized all my reasons were pretty weak. After all, I probably write enough opinion- and observation-based text every day to fill more than a few posts:  professors and research managers are essentially machines that turn coffee into email, after all.

So, I'm going to try and do better.  More posts about things I care about, some short, some long, some insightful, some ... perhaps less insightful?  We'll see how it goes.
