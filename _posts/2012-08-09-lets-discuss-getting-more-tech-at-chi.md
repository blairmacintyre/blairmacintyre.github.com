So, in response to a short article by the ACM CHI Program chair titled ["A Cry for More Tech at CHI!."](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2090154&CFID=70499449&CFTOKEN=98520342), I wrote a blog post (titled "[What? You want us to be your Dancing Bears?](http://ael.gatech.edu/blair/2012/03/14/what-you-want-us-to-be-your-dancing-bears/)") saying why I thought this request was off the mark.

After a lively discussion in the comments, parts of my article and some of the followup commentary, were posted in ACM Interactions last month. Â Perhaps inevitably, a number of us were not satisfied with the outcome of that post.

So, we'd like to collect some more comments and reflections, and author a longer, more well thought out discussion in an upcoming issue.  

So, please, if you have thoughts about how (or how not) to include interactive demos at CHI, chime in!
