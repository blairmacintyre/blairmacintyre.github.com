I don&#8217;t get a lot of time to play &#8220;big&#8221; games;  sometimes it feels like the only time I can find the time to play these games is late at night when my wife is traveling on business (post &#8220;spend the evening with kids, then put in the usual few more hours of work&#8221;).   As my students are tired of me saying, I almost never finish big AAA games (I&#8217;ve finished 2 in recent memory, both during the brief time I tried to play games on the XBox360 while riding an exercise bike).  It&#8217;s just too hard to justify the time.

The biggest problem is that as &#8220;entertainment&#8221;, most big AAA games fail for me, due to a combination of cringeworthy stories, and repetitive game mechanics.  After a while, the time investment is just not worth it, to see the end of a story that I would not make it through in any other media:  heck, I&#8217;d rather watch The Avengers again than slog through &#8220;Black Ops 2&#8221;.  But, I keep trying, because I love the idea of a rich story (good enough that I might enjoy it in another form) and interactions that are fun throughout the whole game.

My most recent attempt:  the new Tomb Raider.  I&#8217;ve never gotten into Tomb Raider games, for various reasons.  But, since it was getting such good reviews, I decided to give it a go (plus, it might be one of the last big AAA story-based games, as the genre disappears entirely into the all-consuming void of F2P tablet-based game-snacks).

I&#8217;ve only put in about 3-4 hours so far, but I&#8217;m really happy I did.  I can&#8217;t think of a movie I would have rather watched during that time, for example!  So far, it&#8217;s everything most narrative FPS&#8217;s aren&#8217;t:  I&#8217;m enjoying the story and Laura&#8217;s character development, and the game play isn&#8217;t (too) tedious or repetitive.  This may change as I get further into the game, but at this point most big games (like Call of Duty, Dragon&#8217;s Age, Prototype, etc.) would have reached that horrible stage where the story and characters are making me cringe, and the action sequences are something I&#8217;m trying to slog through in the hopes the story might improve.

Suffice to say, I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised, and don&#8217;t find myself wishing I&#8217;d watched a mindless action flick (or tried to catch up on The Walking Dead) instead.
