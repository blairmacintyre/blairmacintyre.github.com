Last week, I was [excited to try Beat Saber but it failed miserably with the Windows MR display I had hooked up](https://blairmacintyre.me/2018/05/01/beat-saber-windows-mr-fail).  I said I was going to dig out the Rift from its box and see if a display with outside-in tracking would work and not have the tracking dropouts that the Windows MR display did.

{% marginnote "problems" "Aside from my intense annoyance with putting Facebook on my Face."%} Sure enough, it works great.  Played a few rounds through with zero problems with tracking loss.  Of course, there were other problems.  Most obviously, my arm got tangled in the display cord a few times (a minor issue, relative to complete tracker failure).  The second issue I had was with the ergonomics of the Oculus Touch controllers for this kind of game:  no matter how I tried to hold them, I kept accidentally hitting buttons and interrupting the game.  (This will probably get better with time, I just haven't used the Touch controllers that much). 

I will admit, the Rift is way more comfortable than the Vive or either of the Windows MR displays I have.  But I prefer the ergonomics of the Vive controllers more than the others (with Windows MR second, and the Touch last).

If you haven't tried [Beat Saber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/), and you've been looking for a VR game, you should check it out! So much fun!
