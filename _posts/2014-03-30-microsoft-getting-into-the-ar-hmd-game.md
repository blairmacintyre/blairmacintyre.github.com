An interesting article came by today on geek.com titled [Microsoft buys $150M worth of head-mounted wearable display patents](http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-buys-150m-worth-of-head-mounted-wearable-display-patents-1589620/).  I think it&#8217;s interesting because while the focus is on &#8220;look, MS might be getting in the VR HMD game, following Facebook + Oculus and Sony&#8217;s Project Morpheus&#8221;, it also points out that the bulk of the purchased patents deal with see-through displays.  I don&#8217;t know much about Osterhout Design Group (and as the article says, most people don&#8217;t), so it remains to be seen if the patents are really worth much ($150M does not seem like that much in the patent game, so this may just be a defensive &#8220;we&#8217;ll buy the possible junk patents that could let a troll target us&#8221; kind of move).  However, either way, it may signal that MS is interested in see-through AR (rather than cut-yourself-off-from-the-world VR) displays.  Which is pretty cool!
