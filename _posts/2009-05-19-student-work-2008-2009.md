I've been quiet for a while (family stuff), but will start posting again.  I normally don't focus on my own work, but I'm so proud of the work my students did this year, I want to share.  First, as [Ori points out over on his blog](http://gamesalfresco.com/2009/05/12/ar-game-designs-from-georgia-tech/), I finally posted the videos from our class projects last fall (wow, did that take a while).  For those that don't know, last fall I taught a class (coordinated with a class taught by Tony Tseng at [SCAD-Atlanta](http://www.scad.edu/atlanta/)) on handheld AR game design.  It was pretty rough on the students (old, flaky hardware; new, work-in-progress software), but they did a great job.  We had them design and build a new game every month, so it was fast paced and fun.  Here's a [link to the playlist of the videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYM7INeqiGA&feature=PlayList&p=3452DE575029A951&index=0&playnext=1) I posted (not all the games from the class, as a few games never resulted in videos on my computer ...).  The game voted best game was Candy Wars, which I'll embed here.

We also wrote a paper on the class, which was presented at the ACM Foundations of Digital Games conference.  We also have a paper in the SIGGRAPH Games Track (on our collaborative AR game, Art of Defense), but I haven't posted the final video yet (I'll do that in a few weeks).

Finally, Kim and David improved our zombie shooter game (that I showed off at GDC);  there's a new, much cooler video, up.  The game is now called ARhrrrr ...
