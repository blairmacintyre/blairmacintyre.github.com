While I usually reserve this spot to comment on the AR stuff other folks are working on, I thought I&#8217;d take this opportunity to comment on something we just released.

My colleague Maribeth Gandy and I create a small startup this year called [Aura Interactive](http://www.aurainteractive.com);  while we are doing a variety of things with the company, ranging from consulting to product development, our main goal is to create some fun AR games and toys.

And so I&#8217;m happy to share that we&#8217;ve just had our first iPhone application (done in collaboration with our colleague Kim Spreen) go live in the iTunes App Store, a little toy we call [SantaVision](http://www.aurainteractive.com/applications/santavision/) (click [here](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=346192213&mt=8) to go directly to the app in the iTunes Store).

Like many people, we&#8217;ve struggled with the inability to &#8220;touch&#8221; the live video on the iPhone, and the corresponding inability to do accurate, fast 3D tracking, of the sort we leverage in our research prototypes (e.g., the Zombie shooter [ARhrrrr!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNu4CluFOcw)).  At the same time, we&#8217;ve want to avoid creating yet-another shoot-the-<xxxxx>-around-you compass-based game, a couple more of which appeared today.  We think we have come up with a fun middle ground, leveraging the accelerometer and compass to let people immerse themselves inside small AR Christmas scenes they create themselves, using the &#8220;stickers&#8221; (static and animated images), sound effects and music loaded into the application.  And, using the GPS, you can share your geo-located scenes with the world.

If you try it, let me know what you think.  It&#8217;s not perfect, but we&#8217;re having fun with it!
