I've set Overwatch aside for a while, and have been revisting old games I never finished (or hadn't even started).  Sadly, I've found the experience less than satisfying, as I summarized on Mastodon this morning:{% marginnote "dug" "Don't even get me started on some of the more purely narrative games, like Dear Esther and Gone Home."%}

I'm going to try something newer soon, though.

Hopefully, there won't be too many of the "oh look, arrow in the throat" and "oh look, impaled on plane wreck in river" loops like in the first one (two memorable vignettes that I had trouble finishing without dying, the same way, over and over).
