First, in the spirit of full disclosure, I will point out that one of the students in my lab built this demo.  So, I&#8217;m obviously biased.  

That said, I am pretty impressed with what she managed to pull off in a very short time.  Ignoring the work involved in hacking the iPhone to get video out of the camera, and porting a little 3D loader/rendering to the phone, she managed to work in quite a few of the ideas we&#8217;ve been batting around about how to take advantage of the iPhone for handheld AR;  a bunch of things are still not in there, but will be eventually.  

The idea motivating this project is the old &#8220;Virtual Pet&#8221;, with the goal of having an individual&#8217;s pet be available on different platforms (handheld 3D, handheld AR, desktop 3D, etc), and of having multiple people&#8217;s pets be able to play with each other.  More interestingly, we hope to have the environment&#8217;s in which you play with your pet affect their growth and behavior.  We&#8217;ll see how far we get!

Here&#8217;s a video of the current prototype.
