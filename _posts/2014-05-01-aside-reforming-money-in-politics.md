_[For those who don&#8217;t agree with campaign, please forgive me posting this in my blog;  I prefer to focus here on technology and design issues.  However, I believe strongly in this issue and want to help spread the word!]_

May 1, 2014:  Today, [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org) has launched his [Mayday.us](http://mayday.us) campaign against corruption in American politics, with the goal of creating the Citizen&#8217;s SuperPAC to End All SuperPACs.  If you aren&#8217;t aware of this, please check out the site or watch his video:

<span class="vvqbox vvqvimeo" style="width:400px;height:300px;"></span> 

I strongly support this.  As someone described it in an article on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2014/05/01/mayday-larry-lessig-launches.html)

> <span style="color: #111111;">They&#8217;re calling it a moonshot. It&#8217;s audacious, improbable, and desperately needed.</span>

If you agree, please donate and help spread the word!
