_[For those who don't agree with campaign, please forgive me posting this in my blog;  I prefer to focus here on technology and design issues.  However, I believe strongly in this issue and want to help spread the word!]_

May 1, 2014:  Today, [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org) has launched his [Mayday.us](http://mayday.us) campaign against corruption in American politics, with the goal of creating the Citizen's SuperPAC to End All SuperPACs.  If you aren't aware of this, please check out the site or watch his video:

I strongly support this.  As someone described it in an article on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2014/05/01/mayday-larry-lessig-launches.html)

>They're calling it a moonshot. It's audacious, improbable, and desperately needed.

If you agree, please donate and help spread the word!
