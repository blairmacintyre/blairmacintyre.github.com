I'm in Chicago for work, and a group of us went to see Hamilton last night.

{% maincolumn 'assets/uploads/img_2120.jpg' "Hamilton is doing a long run at the CIBC Theatre in Chicago." %}

{% marginnote "kids" "We have two school-ago kids, and there was a long period of time where it seemed that they and _everyone_ they knew was into Hamilton." %}The show was great!  But after listening to the Original Cast Recording enough to have it memorized, it's super-hard to avoid comparing what you're seeing to the "music you know". 

{% newthought "The cast" %} was really good, but it took a little while into the show for me to stop thinking "That's good, but they're _singing it wrong_!"  

That's the Curse of the Cast Recording.
