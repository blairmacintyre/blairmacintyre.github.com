This is more like VR than AR, but worth looking at none-the-less.  

A student of mine just sent me a link to this, and I must say it's awesome.   The story is fairly simple, as the comments point out, but the visuals and the conception are really really wonderful.  This is what SecondLife will be someday, perhaps?
