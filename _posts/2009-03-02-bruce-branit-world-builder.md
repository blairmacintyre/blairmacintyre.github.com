This is more like VR than AR, but worth looking at none-the-less.  

A student of mine just sent me a link to this, and I must say it&#8217;s awesome.   The story is fairly simple, as the comments point out, but the visuals and the conception are really really wonderful.  This is what SecondLife will be someday, perhaps?
