In a [post last month](/2018/03/20/i-love-esports-games-but-i-m-giving-up-on-them/) I said goodbye to playing [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/) because I was so frustrated with the matchmaking in the Competative Mode (which is mostly what I liked playing).  I've been popping in occasionally and playing a game or two, although I'll not play it anywhere near as much as I used to.  I still mostly enjoy competative, but can't imagine ever getting into it as much as before.

That said, I ended the last season with my highest ranking ever, breaking out of bronze and finishing just below my season high in very-low-silver.  So, perhaps this is for the best.
