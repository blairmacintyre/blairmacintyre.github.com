Last september, I was quoted in an AJC (Atlanta Journal Constitution) article on the iPhone and Apple&#8217;s App Store. No big deal, just another quote. Yesterday, I stumbled upon what appears to be the result of running that article through a two-way automated translation program &#8230; anyway have a guess what language it went through? Italian, perhaps? It&#8217;s hard to tell. <img src="http://blairmacintyre.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The original article is [here,](http://www.ajc.com/living/content/printedition/2008/09/08/iphoneapps.html) and the surreal version is [here](http://inet7camerasca.blogspot.com/2009/02/app-store-icing-on-iphone_01.html).  What fun.
