Last september, I was quoted in an AJC (Atlanta Journal Constitution) article on the iPhone and Apple's App Store.  No big deal, just another quote. Yesterday, I stumbled upon what appears to be the result of running that article through a two-way automated translation program ... anyway have a guess what language it went through?  Italian, perhaps?  It's hard to tell. :)

The original article is [here,](http://www.ajc.com/living/content/printedition/2008/09/08/iphoneapps.html) and the surreal version is [here](http://inet7camerasca.blogspot.com/2009/02/app-store-icing-on-iphone_01.html).  What fun.
