Next week is the annual [ISMAR](http://ismar08.org/wiki/doku.php) (International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality) Symposium, in Cambridge, England.  I'll be heading there this weekend, and expect it to be the usual mix of tracking, applications, studies and demos.  It'll be a lot of fun, and promises to show us all where the next generation of AR is headed.

I'll be helping run a tutorial (on [Handheld Augmented Reality](http://ismar08.org/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorialworkshop-handheld)), demoing a handheld AR game (Art of Defense, running on Nokia N95 phones), and watching my just-graduated student Cindy present a paper (An Evaluation of Graphical Context in Registered AR, Non-Registered AR, and Heads-Up Displays). 

See you all there!
