Next week is the annual [ISMAR](http://ismar08.org/wiki/doku.php "ISMAR") (International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality) Symposium, in Cambridge, England.  I&#8217;ll be heading there this weekend, and expect it to be the usual mix of tracking, applications, studies and demos.  It&#8217;ll be a lot of fun, and promises to show us all where the next generation of AR is headed.

I&#8217;ll be helping run a tutorial (on [Handheld Augmented Reality](http://ismar08.org/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorialworkshop-handheld)), demoing a handheld AR game (Art of Defense, running on Nokia N95 phones), and watching my just-graduated student Cindy present a paper (An Evaluation of Graphical Context in Registered AR, Non-Registered AR, and Heads-Up Displays). 

See you all there!
