I ran across an ambitiously titled article in the Atlantic, "[The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete (Here’s what’s next)](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)". The title felt a bit like click-bait, but as an academic, that kind of bold pronouncement is hard to resist.

**TL;DR**: Static papers will be replaced by papers with interactive figures.

Yep, that's pretty much the gist of it. Nothing new here, really, and certainly no insight as to "what's next."  

Worse, the article ignores the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption of interactive articles.

He spends much time talking about folks pushing the vision and tools of interactive documents, from [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/) to Stephen Wolfram to [Fernando Perez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-perez). He neatly summarizes the approaches to live interactive documents, giving some examples.

The vision is also much older that the author implies. Surely the [Dynabook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook) painted this vision;  as did the [Memex[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) to a certain extent.  It's been the basis of [Scifi novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) as well. The interactive vs dynamic media discussion isn't new.{% marginnote "sticky" "The author touches on the sticky issue of how these interactive papers could be practically shared and reliably archived, but glosses over the core problems.  Web and computing technology changes rapidly, and companies have shown little taste for backwards compatibility.  As all those old documents on my computer remind me, sitting there with no easy way for me to open them. That said, it's possible to imagine solutions emerging, perhaps expanding the scope of formats like PDF to include interactive elements that are sufficiently powerful; you can already [embed movies](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/how-to-add-video-to-interactive-pdfs) in PDF, why not other things?"%}  

{% newthought "Why do we" %} still publish papers?  The core reason is that they provide a verifiable nugget of information that can be reviewed, vetted and shared. That's it. The author says that up from, when talking about how journals started.

> The scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.

There is an implication here, though.  For something to be reviewed and vetted, it has to be possible for a reasonable expert to review and vet it.  Interactive content throws a huge roadblock in reviewing papers, and by implication, in reading and learning from them.


* Does science become the domain of those capable of creating effective and compelling simulations and interactive figures?  Creating compelling interactive figures is, and will be, harder than static figures illustrating specific points.



The second two are stickier.    

{% newthought "Reviewing"  %} interactive documents is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to including simulations as part of the publication process.  The naive stance implicit in this article is that somehow interactivity is "better" and gives us more insight.  But, simulations are simplifications, and perhaps more insidious ones when it comes to misleading:  an unholy combination of "a picture is worth a thousand words" and "
