Lance Weatherby posted a link to this video on [his blog](http://blog.weatherby.net/2014/05/free-is-a-lie.html), and I agree with him that it&#8217;s interesting and worth watching.

While the presenter (Aral Balkan) is a bit over the top in his analysis of Google (e.g., I really don&#8217;t think Project Tango is a grand conspiracy by Google to secretly map the inside of everyone&#8217;s house), I do think the point he gets to later in the video (when he shifts from the implications of our ceding our data to the big 4 &#8211; Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter &#8211; to his thoughts on user experience) are interesting. His point about the main problem with the &#8220;Free&#8221; alternatives are insightful.

It&#8217;s worth a watch!  Here&#8217;s the description of the video, from youtube:

> It&#8217;s time for a design revolution in open technology. Companies like Google and Facebook that dominate the Internet promise us free services in exchange for the right to watch and study us; to mine and farm us. Like quarries, like livestock, we are natural resources to be exploited in a brave new digital world of corporate surveillance that threatens our most fundamental freedoms.
> 
> There are open alternatives but they are too difficult for most of us to use.
> 
> It is time to bring design thinking to open source and build beautiful, seamless open consumer products that are easy to use and which respect our fundamental freedoms.
