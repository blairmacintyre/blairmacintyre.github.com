The New York times had a piece on eSports yesterday ([All We Want to Do Is Watch Each Other Play Video Games: Gamers are the new stars. Esports arenas are the new movie theaters.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/style/fortnite.html?hpw&rref=technology&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well)) that wasn't that bad, for a change.  It dove a bit into the growing popularity of competative gaming, but especially gaming as a spectator sport.

I love games, especially online multiplayer competative gaming (although, perhaps [love-hate is a more apt description](/2018/03/20/i-love-esports-games-but-i-m-giving-up-on-them/) to my [ever-changing relationship with them](/2018/04/28/overwatch)). I avoided the MMO craze, never putting much time into games like World of Warcraft, because couldn't stand the idea of "the grind", spending endless hours kill monsters to get more powerful so I could spend endless hours killing stronger monsters.  The social aspects had some appeal, but the idea of grinding outweighed them.

Competative games, where each self-contained match takes a small amount of time (say, 5-30 minutes) are different. There's no grind, you you get better over time because you are actually getting better at the controls, the game mechanics,  strategy and other aspects of "game sense" (a catch-all for things you need to understand in order to win).  As I've written, these games share a lot with what draws people to sports.

The rise in popularity of watching other people play games also shares a lot with the popularity of watching sports: I like watching sports because I played them, and so I can appreciate the skill and difficulty of what the players are doing.  I've watched some [Overwatch League](https://overwatchleague.com) games (Go Gladiators!) and it's exactly the same as watching hockey or basketball for me:  it's also just as opaque and confusing for people who don't play these games as watching hockey is for people who have never played.
