Over the past week, I've finished cleaning up the blog on my personal website, which I started moving from Wordpress to Jekyll earlier this year.  As I was going through the posts, I ran across a lot of old content I want to revisit, but was especially pleased to see an [old post](/2008/09/30/ar-art-todaysart08/) from back in 2008 about the _architectural projective AR_ art of [Pablo Valbuena](http://www.pablovalbuena.com/).  He's continued making really interesting pieces, here are a few of the newer ones.

And, of course, here's a link back to the first one I saw, the projective outdoor art project at The Hague, called _N 520437 E 041900 \[the hague city hall\]_{% marginnote "hague" "[http://www.pablovalbuena.com/selectedwork/n-520437-e-041900/](http://www.pablovalbuena.com/selectedwork/n-520437-e-041900/)" %}:
