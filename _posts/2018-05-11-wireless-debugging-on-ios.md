How did I miss knowing about [wireless debugging on iOS](https://codeburst.io/wireless-debugging-ios-run-debug-install-builds-over-wifi-a48fc49ac3a7)?  You can build, depoly and debug on iOS and AppleTV without a cable! {% marginnote "charging" "Keeping the phone charged was another reason to plug in, but with wireless charging, I just have to remember to put the phone down on the charging pad.  Easy-peasy!" %}That's great, especially for folks like me who are doing AR development, where being tethered by a cable is a pain in the butt.

All you have to do is check the "Connect via network" checkbox in the Devices tab for your device.

Even better for me (as a web developer) is that Safari supports wireless debugging now too!

Happy development, everyone!
