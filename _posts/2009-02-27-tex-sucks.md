I realize this really doesn't have much to do with AR, but I've finally had enough.  I've used TeX and LaTeX for too many papers (because some of my students and colleagues have been seduced by the Dark Side) and for one of my dissertations.  Enough is enough.  No more TeX.  

In fact, I hate it so much, I created a [mug](http://www.zazzle.com/tex_sucks_mug-168216535829787343) (and [shirt](http://www.zazzle.com/tex_sucks_tshirt-235630926907495534)) on my [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/aelatgt) site to express my feelings.  I will drink coffee proudly from this mug, knowing that from my bravery, those around me may derive the courage they need to join me in coming out about their feelings.  

Repeat after me:  TeX Sucks.  Documents should be written, not programmed.
