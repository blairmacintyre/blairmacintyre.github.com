In his keynote at AGDC, Bruce Sterling pushed the idea that in the future, [all games will be AR games](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20267).  His premise of coming back from the future as a student sent by his older self, to talk about the industry in 2043 (35 years from now) is a bit trite, but how can I argue with the observation that

> And the games of 2043? &#8220;They&#8217;re not the kind of games that were developed for flat glass screens &#8212; cumbersome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t pretend that a flat glass screen is a window into a virtual world&#8230; the idea sounds silly to us.&#8221;
> 
> Then what do the games of 2043 look like? &#8220;I think you would call [them] &#8216;augmented reality&#8217; but we don&#8217;t,&#8221; Sterling continued. &#8220;We think that reality is real &#8212; you can have a lot of fun with [an overlaid] game interface.&#8221; To Sterling, the games of the future scale from personal &#8220;body games&#8221; to global games and space games and everything in between &#8212; including &#8220;neighborhood games&#8221;. More importantly, &#8220;[In 2043] we&#8217;ve got 70 years of computer games &#8212; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got that you don&#8217;t have &#8212; and we got it from you. All kinds of dead intellectual properties and platforms, all being continually re-released.&#8221; 

It sounds like it was a bit of a light, motivational talk, but it seems everyone is getting the AR bug these days.
