Sticking with the [daily blogging goal](https://blairmacintyre.me/2018/04/24/just-post-it) has been a challenge, mostly because it takes so long to write, reread and check these posts.  Hopefully now that I've gotten most of those "I really want to write a post about X" out of my head, things might go faster?
