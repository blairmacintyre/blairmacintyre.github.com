I've been at Mozilla for over and year and have been watching the leadup to the release of [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) this week, and have been musing a lot about the future of education in the age of MOOCs and VR.  Ironically, Ready Player One was released recently, which paints a quite bleak picture of the future of online education via VR ... well, perhaps it paints a bleak picture of the future, with online education in VR being a bright spot ... depends on your viewpoint.

If you hit up The Goog with the right keywords, you can read endless articles about distance education, on-campus (resident) education, online education, flipped classrooms, and other intertwined topics like state vs private vs for-profit schools, vocational vs liberal arts education, the costs of college, and on and on.

Technology is making it easier to deliver online classes, and there is a lot of folks who seem behind it. At Georgia Tech, the OMSCS has generated rave reviews, including mentions from the former President Obama.  

{% newthought "It's all" %} well and good that we are getting better at delivering online education, but it makes me wonder about the paucity of articles talking about the value of going to campus at all. There are plenty of articles comparing online to traditional educaiton; plenty discussing how to maximize traditional education on campus (learning centers, facilities, how to structure a class, ...);  but few asking the question:  if we can deliver some content (how much? what kind?) effectively online, and we accept that, what _should_ we do to maximize the value of being on campus?

Let's ignore the debate of "can online match in-person": there are so many variables that make that a complex discussion (amazing online might beat mediocre in person; some courses work better in different formats; different people need different support; etc).  And, then there is economics and other practical issues: online is cheaper, and for some people, cheaper will trump better.

{% newthought "Instead, let's acknowledge" %} that the online vs on-campus is a false choice.  If the breadth our our choice (and the limit of our imagination) is "do we deliver the 3-credit-hour class online or on campus" we've already lost the future.  There are so many other things to consider, and ways of maximizing the value of both.  

Online classes don't have to be the MOOC-style everyone-alone-with-an-online-chat-room. They might be structured as remotely delivered classes, where people gather at smaller schools (community colleges? Non-research universities? High schools?  Community centers?) and local facilitators have the materials and resources to support local groups working and learning together. Why have AP classes in high school when a high school could actually _host_ sessions of the actual colleges classes the students are supposely getting out of by taking AP?  Why not let students attending small regional schools take classes from the top schools with a local teacher and cohort of students?  

Similarly, on-campus classes don't have to be broken down into quarter- or semester-at-a-time units.  That's done for practical or historical reasons, but if we break off a large part of the current degree into online, remote or self-directed study, perhaps whatever is left could be delivered in entirely different ways.

Ways that **maximize the value** of being on campus.  Perhaps much of your on-campus time is spent in studios, building things that require you to synthesize what you learn in these other classes, and support you in learning the core material.  My father-in-law is a nuclear engineer and former VP at Oakridge labs, and he used to teach a capstone at UT Knoxville.  He told me about a project he designed one year, where he had the students design a reactor for the surface of Mars.  It required them to both learn the core knowledge they needed, but also understand it enough to apply it in a different context: different gravity and atmosphere, different dust and particles in the air, and so on.  Why do our students only get one capstone?  Why aren't they doing projects like this every year?   And why do their projects typically get limited to a single semester or year?

One elephant in the room is: what is the material, out of the breadth of what we want students to learn as part of a degree, that is amenable to delivery in a supported online format?  Which topics? Perhaps it's a few intro classes.  Perhaps it's 1/2 to 3/4 of the degree.  I don't see us asking this question ... perhaps we're afraid of the answer?  

There is clearly value to being in a community of learners, being exposed to new people and challenged in discussions and projects.  For many, the opportunity to do research is a huge benefit;  for others, the growing number of entreprenurial activities tied into degrees.  

Ideally, we would
