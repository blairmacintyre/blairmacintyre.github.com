I've been at Mozilla for over a year and have been watching the leadup to the release of [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) (just this week).  Over these past months, Hubs has been [making me ponder the future of education (and other things)](/2018/04/26/bespoke-social-xr)  in the age of MOOCs and VR.  Conicidentally, Ready Player One was released recently, which paints a quite bleak picture of the future of online education via VR; perhaps it paints a bleak picture of the future, with online education in VR being a bright spot, it depends on your viewpoint.

If you are curious about where higher education (in particular) is going, you can hit up The Goog with the right keywords and read endless articles about distance education, on-campus (resident) education, online education, flipped classrooms, and other intertwined topics like state vs private vs for-profit schools, vocational vs liberal arts education, the costs of college, and on and on.

It's clear that technology is making it easier to deliver online classes, and there are a lot of folks  bullish about the possibilities. At Georgia Tech, the [Online Master's in CS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) has generated rave reviews, including mentions from the former President Obama.  

{% newthought "It's all" %} well and good that we are getting better at delivering online education, and it's exciting that technology may make things even better. But it makes me wonder about the paucity of articles talking about the _value of going to campus._ 

There are plenty of articles comparing online to traditional education; plenty discussing how to maximize traditional education on campus (learning centers, facilities, how to structure a class, ...);  but few asking the question:  if we can deliver some content (how much? what kind?) effectively online, and we accept that, what _should we do to maximize the value of being on campus_?\
{% marginnote "debate" "Let's ignore the debate of whether online can match in-person education: there are so many variables that make that a complex discussion (amazing online might beat mediocre in person; some courses work better in different formats; different people need different support; etc).  And, then there is economics and other practical issues: online is cheaper, and for some people, cheaper will trump better." %}

{% newthought "The first thing to note" %} is that  "online" vs "on-campus" is a false choice.  If the breadth our our choice (and the limit of our imagination) is "do we deliver 3-credit-hour classes online or on campus" we've already lost the future. There are so many other things to consider, and ways of maximizing the value of both.  

Online classes don't have to be the MOOC-style everyone-alone-with-an-online-chat-room. They might be structured as remotely delivered classes, where people gather at smaller schools (community colleges? Non-research universities? High schools?  Community centers?) and local facilitators have the materials and resources to support local groups working and learning together. Why have AP classes in high school when a high school could actually _host_ sessions of the actual colleges classes the students are supposely getting out of by taking AP?  Why not let students attending small regional schools take classes from the top schools with a local teacher and cohort of students?  

Similarly, on-campus classes don't have to be broken down into quarter- or semester-at-a-time units.  That's done for logistical and historical reasons, but if we break off a large part of our current degrees into online, remote or self-directed study, perhaps whatever is left could be delivered in entirely different ways?

Ways that **maximize the value** of being on campus.  

What might this mean?  Perhaps much of a student's on-campus time is spent in studios, building things that require them to synthesize what they learn in these other classes, and support them learning the core material.  My father-in-law is a nuclear engineer and former VP at Oakridge labs, and he used to teach a capstone at UT Knoxville.  He told me about a project he designed one year, where he had the students design a reactor for the surface of Mars.  It required them to both learn the core knowledge they needed, but also understand it deeply enough to apply their knowledge in a different context: different gravity and atmosphere, different dust and particles in the air, and so on.  

Many of our programs have capstones of various sizes and lengths:  but why do our students typically only get one capstone?  Why aren't they doing projects like this continuously?   And why do their projects typically get limited to a single semester or year?  Perhaps on campus students should spend _most of their time doing projects, entreprenurial activities, or research?_

{% newthought "One elephant" %} in the room is how much the students actually _need to be on campus._  What is the percentage of material, out of the breadth of what we want students to learn as part of a degree, that is amenable to delivery in a supported online format?  Which topics? Perhaps it's a few intro classes? Perhaps it's 1/2 to 3/4 of the degree?  

I don't see colleges asking this question ... perhaps they're afraid of the answer?  

{% newthought "I personally" %} feel there is incredible value to being on campus at a top tier university.  There is clearly value to being in a community of learners, being exposed to new people, and being challenged in discussions and projects.  For many, the opportunity to do research is a huge benefit;  for others, the growing number of entreprenurial activities tied into degrees.  

Ideally, we would figure out where the true value lies, and find ways of maximizing people's time, money and effort.  Imagine a future where students can cover significant material in well supported remote and online communities, and come together on campuses for a much shorter and more focused period.  

Campuses as we know them would change dramatically, of course, but perhaps those changes would be for the better.  

If we don't figure this out, though, campuses may change anyway, and not for the better of anyone.
