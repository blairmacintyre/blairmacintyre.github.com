If you hit up The Google with the right keywords, you can read endless articles about distance education, on-campus (resident) education, online education, flipped classrooms, and other intertwined topics like state vs private vs for-profit schools, vocational vs liberal arts education, the costs of college, and on and on.

I've been at Mozilla for over and year and have been watching the leadup to the release of [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) this week, and have been musing a lot about the future of education in the age of MOOCs and VR.  Ironically, Ready Player One was released recently, which paints a quite bleak picture of the future of online education via VR.
