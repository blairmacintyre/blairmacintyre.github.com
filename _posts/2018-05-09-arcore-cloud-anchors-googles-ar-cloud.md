At [Google I/O today](https://events.google.com/io/) Google announced [ARCore Cloud Anchors](https://www.blog.google/products/google-vr/experience-augmented-reality-together-new-updates-arcore/) among other updates to ARCore.  The purpose is to simplify creating shared experiences:

> Many things in life are better when you do them with other people. That’s true of AR too, which is why we’re introducing a capability called Cloud Anchors that will enable new types of collaborative AR experiences, like redecorating your home, playing games and painting a community mural—all together with your friends. You’ll be able to do this across Android and iOS.
