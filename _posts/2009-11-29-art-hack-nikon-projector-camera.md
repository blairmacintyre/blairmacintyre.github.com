Most people who know me know that I remain unconvinced of the usefulness of wearing projectors around your neck, despite all the cute <span style="text-decoration: line-through">fake</span> mocked-up demos that people do. Â But, if you are going to do something with projectors, that isn&#8217;t going to work &#8220;in the real world&#8221; anyway, why not something cool like this? (As an added bonus, this is done with a pile of those new Nikon cameras with the projectors built in.)
