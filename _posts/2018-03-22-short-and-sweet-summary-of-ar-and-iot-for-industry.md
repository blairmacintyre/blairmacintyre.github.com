Ran across this short article in Information Week ([The Biggest Capital Asset: IoT & Augmented Reality](https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/the-biggest-capital-asset-iot-and-augmented-reality-/a/d-id/1331332?_mc=rss_x_iwr_edt_aud_iw_x_x-rss-simple)) and while it's short and high level, it is a nice summary of the obvious way IoT plus AR would benefit capital intensive industries (i.e., industrials with a huge investment in expensive machines).

It's a quick read. The essense is to use IoT and remote management to catch problems early and possibly solve them from afar, and add in AR support when technicians need to be there.  Complete integration means seeing sensor, historical, maintenance and part-ordering information _in situ_ with AR, when technicians are on site.
