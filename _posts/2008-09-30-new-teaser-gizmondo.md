    Engadget has a new article with details on the schedule for when we might see a new <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/gizmondo">Gizmondo</a>.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Gizmondo when under back in 2006 under dubious circumstances, but it&#8217;s still got some legs (especially if some of the core chips are updated, even slightly).  I have been using them in my research since the summer of 2006, when NVidia gave me my first one (they didn&#8217;t want to dish out GOForce dev kits to us lowly academics, so they gave me a Gizmondo with the technical information on the GOForce 4500 chipset inside it).

    After the company crashed (figuratively and literally), it became increasingly easy to pick them up on eBay &#8230; I ended up with a dozen or so, and amazingly enough, they are STILL one of the best devices for handheld AR 2 years later (on a price/performance level).  Rugged, easy to program, decent camera, ok 3D.

    Right now we&#8217;re running a <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs4803_fall/">course</a> on handheld augmented reality game design using the Gizmondo, where we have a great set of students (<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/">CS</a> and <a href="http://www.cm.gatech.edu/">CM</a> students from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>, and design/animation students from <a href="http://www.scad.edu/atlanta/">SCAD-Atlanta)</a> working to prototype AR games;  we&#8217;ll see how it goes, but the first round of prototypes were pretty descent!

  <p>
    It would be nice to have new Gizmondo&#8217;s to run them on some day &#8230;
