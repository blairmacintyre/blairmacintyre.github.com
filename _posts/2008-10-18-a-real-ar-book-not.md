Picked up a pointer to an [AR Book](http://mark-logan.blogspot.com/2008/10/augmented-reality-pop-up-books.html) being shown at a German book fair.  While this blogger, and the blogger he points at, note that this is a &#8220;real&#8221; book (meaning, I assume, it will be for sale) rather than a demo, the video leaves the viewer wondering &#8220;so what?&#8221; &#8230;

We&#8217;ve built some AR books, and my friends and colleagues in Graz and HITLabNZ have too.  The critical issue whenever we try them with real people is &#8220;so what?&#8221; &#8230; meaning, why would I want to &#8220;read&#8221; this.

Look at the video being pointed by these articles and ask yourself that question.  At least in the video, these books appear to be nothing more than a placeholder for a (non-?)interactive bit of 3D and audio content;  does this look fun (minus the gee-wiz factor)?  Now look at how it&#8217;s being &#8220;read&#8221; &#8230; the &#8220;reader&#8221; is holding it up FACING AWAY FROM HER toward a camera on a computer screen and having to &#8220;read&#8221; it on the screen;  does this look fun?

I realize that there needs to be a &#8220;first&#8221; one, and that figuring out what the sweet spot and magic sauce will be that makes these work is non-obvious (otherwise, we&#8217;d all be reading them now, right?).  But, I wonder if the folks trying to create these have asked anyone besides their engineers &#8220;What is the real market for these?&#8221;  &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to want to read something like this?&#8221;  &#8220;What makes a 3D AR book good?&#8221; 

There are books:  they have certain appeals, they have certain affordances. There are computer games:  ditto, certain appeals and affordances.  &#8220;Magic books&#8221; of this sort appear, to me, to combine the WORST of both, not the best.

I don&#8217;t think it has to be so.  It&#8217;s clear that there is an intuitive appeal to having books become 3D.  But, like print books before them, it&#8217;s the actually content (not the technology) that matters.

The metaio tech looks pretty good, if they can get it off the laptop and onto a device that might actually be more conducive to the &#8220;book&#8221; experience.  And if someone can get some good content in there.
