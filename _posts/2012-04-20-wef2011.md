While I normally post work-related content over on my [AR Blog](http://ael.gatech.edu/blair), I wanted to share this tidbit here because the video is really nicely done.  The World Economic Forum created an Augmented Reality page on their website, which has a slideshare of my presentation at the "Summer Davos" meeting in China last spring along with a video about me and my thoughts on the future of Augmented Reality.  (link no longer works, was at
