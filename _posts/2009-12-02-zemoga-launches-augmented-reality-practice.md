I&#8217;m not quite sure what [this means](http://www.your-story.org/digital-innovation-firm-zemoga-launches-augmented-reality-practice-61779/), but it is probably a good thing:

> Zemoga, a pioneering digital marketing and innovation firm, today announced the launch of its augmented reality (AR) practice, designed to further the company’s work in this groundbreaking technology that has taken the marketing world by storm.
> 
> [&#8230;]
> 
> “We built the prototype of the human heart and could visually demonstrate in a dynamic 3D environment the effect a new drug would have on the heart,” explained Zemoga CEO and co-founder, DJ Edgerton.

I wonder if they are teaming up with an more experienced AR folks (if they are in New York, Steve Feiner&#8217;s group at Columbia seems like a good choice), to more rapidly leverage the research that&#8217;s been done over the years?  Regardless, though, it&#8217;s interesting.
