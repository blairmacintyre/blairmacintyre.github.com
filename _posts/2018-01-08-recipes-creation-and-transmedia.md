Last year, I posted some musings on the question of [MR Blogs](/2017/11/14/what-is-an-mr-blog/), or perhaps, "what will the equivalent of the blog be in an MR world"? Here, "blog" is just a placeholder for "non-trivial collection of content that lots of people can create and share".

I've been throwing this idea at people over the past month or so, and have started to think of it more as an end-to-end problem: what makes blogging possible is that the content elements people put in blogs (text, pictures, videos) are easy to create, edit and mix together. So, asking "what is the MR equivalent to a blog?" is intimately tied to "what kind of 3D content can we create, edit and mix together?" and "what kinds of compelling experiences can we create with that content?"

One example that crystalized this for me was cooking blogs. Over the holidays, I found myself looking up recipes on the web, and running across a lot of interesting food blogs were more than just traditional collection-of-recipe sites like [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com), such as  or [David Lebovitz](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/)'s blog (see images in the sidebar).

These food blogs are a mix of recipe and story, more blog or magazine than recipe book.  They can get quite detailed, too, and often include many images and videos to help the reader.

{% newthought "When you think" %} about what it takes to create one of these posts, the steps are well known to most of us: take pictures to include, write text, and lay out the story using whatever tools your blog system provides. This might require HMTL and CSS editing, or (more likely) higher level tools like Wordpress's editor or (as I use on this blog) Liquid and Markdown tags that are processed by Jekyll.
