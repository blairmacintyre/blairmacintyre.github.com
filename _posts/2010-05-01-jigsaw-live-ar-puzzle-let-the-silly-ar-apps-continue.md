I was looking at the video of [this app](http://www.xmgstudio.com/?page_id=792), &#8220;Jigsaw Live,&#8221; as I look at most potentially interesting AR apps.  On the surface, it sounds interesting:  &#8221; an AR jigsaw puzzle.&#8221;   I&#8217;ve been interested in making AR jigsaw puzzles for a while (heck, I even went to the extreme of sending mail to my favorite puzzle company, [Stave](http://www.stavepuzzles.com/), to see if I could interest them, to no avail).  But, to me, the concept is about augmenting a puzzle.

After all, AR apps really need to have two components: reality + augmenting.  If reality doesn&#8217;t really matter, than why bother with making it an AR app (for example, holding up the phone in this app to solve the &#8220;puzzle&#8221; is tiring, as it is with any app that requires you to hold the phone up for a period of time).  And, you need to augment the reality in some way &#8230; right?  Bring these two things together, and then add something fun, exciting, engaging or useful.

So, let&#8217;s consider this app, then.

They have reality, you might say. It&#8217;s live video on the puzzle pieces, so that&#8217;s reality, right &#8230; or, is it?  Does reality _matter?_ Not really, actually.  It&#8217;s just video.  Looking at something different doesn&#8217;t change the puzzle, nor affect the program.  Reality is &#8220;just a texture&#8221; &#8230; it could be a video or image from you camera roll, and it wouldn&#8217;t really change things.  The live video is cool at first;  but, in the end, it&#8217;s just a gimmick.

Going further, do they &#8220;augment&#8221; it?  No.  Their &#8220;reality&#8221; (the video texture) augments their puzzle, but reality isn&#8217;t augmented, nothing is moved out into the world, nothing about the world around you is enhanced.

Perhaps the title &#8220;Jigsaw Live:  Augmented Puzzle&#8221; would be a more accurate title?  I think so.   Unfortunately, even the puzzle doesn&#8217;t look that interesting.  Square pieces?  Up to 100?  For $2.99?  Yikes!  I would have bought this and played with it if it was $0.99, since I&#8217;ll pretty much buy any potentially interesting app for that.  But, for $3, you have to do better!    The &#8220;ultimate in puzzle fun&#8221; (to quote their page)?  Really?  One wonders if the authors even played a puzzle (a real one, not one of those 4&#215;4 square slider puzzles, or the cornucopia of lame flash puzzles).

Ah well, another good app name taken.

I&#8217;m including their video here, so you can look at it now, and draw your own conclusions.  What do folks think &#8230; am I being too critical?
