So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye{% sidenote "goodbye" "From the Sound of Music, Rodgers & Hammerstein."%}.

> Dear eSports,

> It's not you, it's me. Well, ok, no.  It's you. 

> I guess it really doesn't matter.  We're through for now.

> Sincerely, Blair 

This weekend, I tweeted a picture of my Skill Rank (SR) when I finally got my [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com) account into Silver in the current season's competitive ranking{% marginfigure "overwatch" "assets/images/overwatch-ranks.png" "I got into Silver in Overwatch. Yippee." %}.

This isn't impressive, trust me. But I'm ok with it, and have no fantasies of getting into Platinum or even higher. I haven't played many shooter games, so my raw shooter skills are "not awesome".  But the thing about Overwatch is there are plenty of characters to play that don't only rely on pure shooter ability. (For those who play, I'm decent at some tanks like D.Va and Orisa, supports like Zenyatta, Lucio, and Mercy, and a few attack heroes like Pharah, Soldier and Tracer.)

## Chasing the Dream

{% newthought "I've been playing"%} for a while because I really like [eSports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) games{% marginnote "games" "I like video games in general, actually. I taught Georgia Tech's Video Game Design and Architecture class (CS4455) for ten years, I've taught more specialized games classes like ones on AR games, and co-ran multiple games Studio classes at the university. Our house has game PCs, every console that's come out in the past dozen years, and so on."%}.  Over the past few years, I've spent a lot of time playing at few, especially [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) and Overwatch. These games  appeal to me because of the things they share with non-electronic sports (more on this below).

Sadly, the genesis of this article is that after finally getting into Silver, I've admitted to myself that, in the end, I like _the idea of playing_ eSports games more than _the experience of playing_ eSports games.  

Which is why, shortly after the above tweet, I decided to stop playing Overwatch. I'm writing this to try and articulate why, beyond what I said in this simple tweet (hint: the phrase "win/lose at mercy of queue" is at the heart of it).

{% twitter https://twitter.com/blairmacintyre/status/975381279058296832 %}

{% newthought "As the tweet implies,"%} I've been down this path before. I stopped playing Rocket League a while ago; I'd gotten ok at the game{% marginfigure "rocketleagueranks" "assets/images/Rocket-League-Season-2-Ranks.jpg" "I did better at Rocket League than Overwatch before I stopped playing in. Not too bad, I think." %} , but was so annoyed at the way the competitive league worked that I actually [permanently deleted my Steam copy of Rocket League](https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/4/9848930/steam-library-delete-games-permanently-how-to){% sidenote "rocket" "Yes, that was a bit childish, I suppose." %}. I was a lot better at Rocket League than I'll ever be at Overwatch, probably because Rocket League's controls didn't require the shooter skills I mentioned above. 

Why am I giving up on these games? I suppose I should start with what draws me to them.

## eSports are like Sport ...

In some (perhaps non-obvious) ways, I'm an ideal demographic for eSports games. Good eSports games (I'd say both Rocket League and Overwatch are good) combine the best of two pastimes that I love: *video games* and *team sports*.  

I grew up playing sports.  I don't follow any leagues or watch regularly (there are a pile of things I'd rather do than watch sports on TV), but if you put me in a room with a sport on TV (any sport ... darts, anyone?) I'll get sucked in. I played hockey, soccer, basketball, baseball, tennis, among others. Town leagues, traveling teams. Touch football at lunch. I was a small kid, and not a star, but I _love_ team sports. The combination of individual skill, game sense, and team coordination, is what makes these sports so much fun. It's not just the ability to sink the jump shot; it's also the perfect pass that leads to a teammates easy basket. It's not just the shot into the corner of the net; it's also the fake shot that your teammate redirects for a goal. 

> Good team sports require that each player has skills and abilities, and can work together as a team. 

And for those who've never played them, eSports games have the same appeal. In a typical game, the team that plays together is the most likely to win{% sidenote "teams" "Let's ignore, for now, the fact that there are often players who are way better that their rank suggests, who can dominate a game by themselves."%}. Each player needs to play well, but it's the combination of skills that will carry the team. When two teams with similar skills levels are playing Overwatch or Rocket League, it's a ton of fun, in the same way that soccer, basketball, hockey and other sports are fun.  Working together, cheering for great plays, grudgingly appreciating great plays by the other team.  

For me, as a guy over 50 who doesn't get to play "real world sports" anymore, these games trigger all the same emotions and feelings that traditional sports did when I was younger. I don't play organized sports anymore; I won't be dunking a basketball{% sidenote "dunk" "I dunked a ball exactly one time on a regulation net: it was enough. Now I can't even touch the rim."%}, shooting a puck, or sprinting down the field any time soon.  

_eSports seemed to offer the allure of that feeling of competition that I really missed_.

## ... but, eSports aren't like Sport

Unfortunately, that satisfying feeling of team competition is the one thing that you rarely get when playing eSports.

It's not that the core mechanics and game design are flawed;  they aren't.  Both Rocket League and Overwatch are elegantly designed. The controls are easy to learn, and hard to master. They are almost entirely skill-based, and take time and effort to improve at; no auto-aim, no click-to-pass. The game structures are designed to encourage and support teamwork.  Both of these attributes (_skill-based play_ and _teamwork_) are what makes them feel like sports.

{% newthought "The problem"%} is the teams, or rather, the way the teams are constructed in the competitive leagues. These games try hard to match you with players of similar skill when you want to play a competitive game, but there are a lot of factors that the _matchmaking system_ can't account for.  

If you've never played one of these games, imagine for a minute that you wanted to join a basketball league. Say it's an intramural league at school, or a city league. The leagues are structures with various levels (A, B, C, etc) and you'd expect that you could bring a team of appropriately skilled (or try out and join a team), and then play together for months. If someone is way too good for the level they join, most leagues will deal with it somehow.  You would expect that by and large, the leagues are balanced and there is cohesion and continuity.

{% newthought "Now imagine instead"%} that you are in a league where every time you go to play a game, you are dropped into a team with a group of random people; some are of similar skill, but sometimes you get a professional player pretending to not be good just so they can have fun by beating up weaker players. Sometimes one of the players just stands to side making snide remarks and actively trying to help the other team. A few of the players in the game spend their time screaming at everyone on the court, sometimes about the game, sometimes about things that have nothing to do with the game.  

And every second or third game, someone just walks away partway through the game, leaving their team to inevitably lose. A few of the people have no idea how to play as a team, or want to: they just want to try and dunk or take 3 point shots every time they get the ball.  Often there's someone who's sure they can carry the team if everyone would just give them the ball and block for them.  

You can bring a few friends who you are comfortable playing with, and the league will make sure the other team has a similar sized group of friends too, but both teams will be filled out with these other folks as well.  If you actually bring a whole team, you'll be matched with another complete team, but there are so few of those that there's almost no chance the two teams are close to each other in skill.

{% newthought "Why would anyone"%} keep coming back to a basketball league like this? Perhaps sometimes a game ends up being balanced, competitive and fun. And perhaps some games end up being downright awesome: everyone working together, trying their best, at a similar skill level, etc. Heck, occasionally you might have a great game, and are the MVP.  

*But anyone would realize pretty fast that, no matter how you play or what you do, winning or losing in a league like this is almost entirely based on who the league assigns to the two teams in your game, and that those good games you remember are actually pretty rare.  Way less than half of the games you play. And the great games even rarer.*

Nobody would play in a basketball league like this.  But that is what eSports competitive modes are like.  

## Can anything be done?

For me, it's the competition against real players that is at the core of the appeal of these games. The extrinsic motivation of some form of ranking (individual or team) seems necessary. 

It's not at all clear what, if anything, can be done about the problems inherent in _automated matchmaking_. These games will always need matchmaking systems, it's what makes them function for most people and lets them scale the a level that makes business sense. There really is no way for an automated system to deal with any of the problems above (it's pretty clear that these companies are trying). Search on youtube, and you'll find no end of videos of people, from novices up through Top 500 players, complaining about the problem.

Adding support for _less automated matchmaking_ would help, essentially building out facilities in these games for anyone to create real local-scale leagues at any level. Overwatch now has a [professional league](https://overwatchleague.com), so in theory they could expose tools to support folks running their own amateur leagues. Why can't a group of high schools have their own league? Or a town? Or a University create an intramural leagues, just like they do for many sports now?  Perhaps if the companies would provide the infrastructure to let _people_ deal with organizing _people_, more people would be able to enjoy eSports.

When it's all said and done, it's unclear how to fix this problem. But, until then, I'm going to spend my leisure time doing other things.
