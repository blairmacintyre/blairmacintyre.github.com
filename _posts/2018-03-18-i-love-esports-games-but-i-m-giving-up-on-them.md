Over the past few years, I've put more hours than I should admit into so-called [eSports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) games.  It started with [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) and then [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com). Most of my friend, grown-ups that they are, roll their eyes at my obsession with these games.  But, as I tweeted today, while I finally have started to have some success at Overwatch, I'm done with them (for the forseeable future).

So, why am I done?

To understand that, you need to understand eSports, especially where the name comes from.  I who grew up playing sports.  Hockey, soccer, basketball, baseball, tennis.  Town leagues, travelling teams. Touch football at lunch. I love team sports. It's the combination of individual skill, game sense, and team coordination, that makes these sports exhilarating. It's not just the ability to sink the jump shot;  it's the no-look pass that leads to a teammates easy score. The redirection of the puck.  Sending a header into the net off a perfect cross.  Working with other people, where each person has different skills and abilities, is what makes sports fun.
