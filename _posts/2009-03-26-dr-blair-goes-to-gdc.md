Ok, I&#8217;ve tried to avoid focusing on my own work here, but it&#8217;s been a fun week at GDC 2009 so far (the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference).  I gave a talk on Handheld AR Games on Monday at the GDC Mobile Summit (Ori [wrote about that](http://gamesalfresco.com/2009/03/24/gdc-2009-i-have-seen-the-future-of-games-and-i-wasnt-alone/)), and met a lot of interesting people after it.  There is clearly a growing understanding that AR is going to be a significant feature in the landscape of mobile AR, which is really exciting!

I also met with some folks from [TouchArcade](http://toucharcade.com), a really great site for iPhone game reviews.  We talked for a while about our little iPhone game demo,and I showed them the other demo game we created on NVidia&#8217;s reference platform. They wrote a [small story about our chat](http://toucharcade.com/2009/03/26/impressive-augmented-reality-game-possibilities-on-the-iphone/); the big point is that, while the current AR games on mobiles are still a bit rough around the edges, when you see what the new platforms (whether NVidia&#8217;s Tegra or TI&#8217;s OMAP3 or Qualcomm&#8217;s SnapDragon), you begin to understand what handheld AR might be like!

Not to leave out some video, here&#8217;s a short video of what I showed them on the NVidia Tegra.

And, for reference, our older iPhone pet game:
