I ran across an article on Geekwire ([Microsoft HoloLens brings 300-year-old 3D model to life and offers new view of French landmark](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/microsoft-hololens-brings-300-year-old-3d-model-life-offers-new-view-french-landmark/)) about using Hololens and photogrammetry to create an augmented reality experience of the combined historic 3D relief map and real site of Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, France.  The videos Microsoft create are worth watching; really inspiring work!

People have talked for decades about how AR might be used to enhance the museum experience, and experimented with (often trivial, sometimes more interesting) examples of the idea.  This looks like a really great use of the technology, I'd love to see it in action.
