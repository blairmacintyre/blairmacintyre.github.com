On March 25th, I gave a short talk at AWE-NY covering some thoughts on developing AR applications using web technologies.  I am particularly interested in developing AR for web browsers, not using web technologies as the development environment for building custom applications.  Of course, I focused on our work on the Argon AR-enabled web browser and the argon.js Javascript toolkit, but I also touched on how these technologies fit without the spectrum, and trajectory, of AR technologies for the web.

At a high level, as some of the currently-proposed technologies for the web (e.g., WebRTC, WebCL, etc) become more widespread, simple AR applications will become possible.  But there are holes that remain, such as the inability to efficiently process real-time video in Javascript, as well as the inability to find out the intrinsic parameters of the device cameras.

Here's the talk, and a PDF of the slides I used.
