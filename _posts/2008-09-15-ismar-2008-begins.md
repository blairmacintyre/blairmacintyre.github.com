I am planning on doing some posts from ISMAR, to highlight what I think is cool.  First, of all, of course, is the city.  Cambridge is wonderful.

Nothing much else to post right now, except to suggest you head over to Games Alfresco, where Ori is covering the conference in depth.  Thanks Ori, it cuts down on what the rest of us need to type.
