My professional life has revolved around academia, research and consulting.  I am currently a professor at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu), in the [School of Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu).  My [publications](/publications/) and [research portfolio](/portfolio) can be found elsewhere on this site, including [direct links](/acmpubs/) to all of my ACM publications in the ACM Digital Library.  A list of classes I am teaching, and have taught in the past, are available (here)[/teaching].

My address at Georgia Tech is:

>Georgia Tech, School of Interactive Computing\\
>85 5th Street NW\\
>Atlanta, GA, 30308\\
>phone: (404) 894-5224

{% newthought "After getting degrees" %} at the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) (in Canada) and [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) (in New York City), I move to [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) in Atlanta.

As a student, I worked as an intern at research labs, including the Waterloo Systems Research Lab, the [Center for the New Oxford English Dictionary](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa/newoed-project.html), Xerox PARC and NYNEX Science and Technology's Research Center.  I was a graduate student at both the University of Waterloo (in the [Computer Graphics Lab](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca)) and Columbia University (the [Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab](http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/)).

{% newthought 'I have been a faculty member' %} at Georgia Tech since the beginning of 1999, where I created and run the GVU Center's [Augmented Environments Lab](http://ael.gatech.edu/lab).  My research is in the area of *Augmented Reality*, an approach to creating interactive computer media where content is directly integrated into a participants experience of the world around them.  My research  has spanned a broad spectrum  of application domains over the years, from military and industrial applications, to art, entertainment, education and games.  I am an active member of the [GVU Center](http://www.gvu.gatech.edu), collaborating with colleagues throughout Georgia Tech.  Since many of my collaborations are with faculty in the [School of Literature, Media and Communication](http://www.lmc.gatech.edu), I am also an adjunct professor there.

The lab's biggest project right now is the [Argon AR Web Browser](http://argon.gatech.edu) and the [argon.js](http://argonjs.io) open source framework for web-based augmented reality.  In the past, I've co-directed the [Augmented Reality Game Studio](http://argamestudio.org) and the [Georgia Tech Game Studio](http://gamestudio.gatech.edu), as well as numerous smaller projects.

I work with a broad range of technology as appropriate for the experience, including handheld, headworn, projection and auditory displays.  Beyond entertainment applications, I have worked on industrial applications of augmented reality with researchers in the GTRI [Food Processing Technology Division](http://foodtech.gatech.edu/).

In my research, I look at both task-focused and experiential systems, and blend elements of augmented and mixed-reality, ubiquitous computing, tangible media and wearable computing. My research addresses various computing issues (including human-computer interaction, computer graphics, computer systems, and software engineering) and design issues (including new media design theory, and tools and theories of design for new media) encountered during the design and implementation of augmented environments.

I am involved with numerous conferences and workshops, and have been a Program Committee Chair for ISWC 2000 (International Symposium on Wearable Computing), ISMAR 2003 (International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality), and UIST 2003 (The ACM Symposium on User-Interface Software and Technology).  I am general chair for ISMAR 2012.

I have served on the editorial boards of <a title="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622846/description#description" href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622846/description#description">The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies</a> and the journal <a title="http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=108194" href="http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=108194">Virtual Reality</a>.  I have served as the guest editor (with Mark Livingston at NRL) of a &#8220;Mixed Reality&#8221; special issue of <a title="http://www.computer.org/cga/" href="http://www.computer.org/cga/">IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications</a>.

{% newthought "In 2009, I co-founded" %} [Aura Interactive](http://www.aurainteractive.com), a design and consulting firm specializing in Augmented Reality entertainment.  After Aura shut down in 2014, I founded _The MacMynatt Group_ in 2015 to continue consulting on design, augmented reality and related technologies.  I have [consulted](/consulting/) for numerous companies, big and small, on design, gaming, business and legal issues related to AR.  I am especially interested in helping push AR from a niche technology to the mainstream, and work with clients to ensure their applications and experiences make effective and compelling use of the technology.
