My professional life has revolved around academia, research and consulting.  I am currently a professor at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu), in the [School of Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu).  After getting degrees at the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) (in Canada) and [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) (in New York City), I move to [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) in Atlanta.

As a student, I worked as an intern at research labs, including the Waterloo Systems Research Lab, the [Center for the New Oxford English Dictionary](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa/newoed-project.html), Xerox PARC and NYNEX Science and Technology's Research Center.  I was a graduate student at both the University of Waterloo (in the [Computer Graphics Lab](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca)) and Columbia University (the [Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab](http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/)).

I have been at Georgia Tech since the beginning of 1999, where I created and run the GVU Center's [Augmented Environments Lab](http://ael.gatech.edu/lab).  My research is in the area of *Augmented Reality*, an approach to creating interactive computer media where content is directly integrated into a participants experience of the world around them.  My research  has spanned a broad spectrum  of application domains over the years, from military and industrial applications, to art, entertainment, education and games.  I am an active member of the [GVU Center](http://www.gvu.gatech.edu), collaborating with colleagues throughout Georgia Tech.  Since many of my collaborations are with faculty in the [School of Literature, Media and Communication](http://www.lmc.gatech.edu), I am also an adjunct professor there.

In 2009, I co-founded [Aura Interactive](http://www.aurainteractive.com), a design and consulting firm specializing in Augmented Reality entertainment.  After Aura shut down in 2014, I founded _The MacMynatt Group_ in 2015 to continue consulting on design, augmented reality and related technologies.  I have consulted for numerous companies, big and small, on design, gaming, business and legal issues related to AR.  I am especially interested in helping push AR from a niche technology to the mainstream, and work with clients to ensure their applications and experiences make effective and compelling use of the technology.








I'm a professor in the [School of Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu).  I hold an adjunct appointment in the [School of Literature, Media and Communication](http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/), and direct the [Augmented Environments Lab](http://www.augmentedenvironments.org/lab).  The lab's biggest project right now is the [Argon AR Web Browser](http://argon.gatech.edu) and the [argon.js](http://argonjs.io) open source framework for web-based augmented reality.  In the past, I've co-directed the [Augmented Reality Game Studio](http://argamestudio.org) and the [Georgia Tech Game Studio](http://gamestudio.gatech.edu), as well as numerous smaller projects.

{% newthought 'I have been a faculty member' %} in the Georgia Tech College of Computing and the GVU Center since January 1999, after finishing a PhD in the <a title="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/" href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Department of Computer Science at Columbia University</a> in New York City. I direct the <a href="http://ael.gatech.edu/lab" target="_blank">Augmented Environments Lab</a>, whose research focuses on the design and implementation of interactive mixed-reality and augmented-reality environments, as well as the tools to support people creating them. The current focus of my work is educational, entertainment and gaming applications of augmented and mixed reality environments.  My current projects focus on handheld AR games, co-located social AR experiences, cognitive models of AR and space, AR and children, and AR software based on web technology.  The latter interest is centered around our <a href="http://argon.gatech.edu" target="_blank">AR Web Browser, Argon</a>.</p>
<p>I work with a broad range of technology as appropriate for the experience, including handheld, headworn, projection and auditory displays.  Beyond entertainment applications, I have worked on industrial applications of augmented reality with researchers in the GTRI <a title="http://foodtech.gatech.edu/" href="http://foodtech.gatech.edu/">Food Processing Technology Division</a>.</p>
<p>In my research, I look at both task-focused and experiential systems, and blend elements of augmented and mixed-reality, ubiquitous computing, tangible media and wearable computing. My research addresses various computing issues (including human-computer interaction, computer graphics, computer systems, and software engineering) and design issues (including new media design theory, and tools and theories of design for new media) encountered during the design and implementation of augmented environments.</p>
<p>I am involved with numerous conferences and workshops, and have been a Program Committee Chair for ISWC 2000 (International Symposium on Wearable Computing), ISMAR 2003 (International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality), and UIST 2003 (The ACM Symposium on User-Interface Software and Technology).  I am general chair for ISMAR 2012.</p>
<p>I have served on the editorial boards of <a title="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622846/description#description" href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622846/description#description">The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies</a> and the journal <a title="http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=108194" href="http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=108194">Virtual Reality</a>.  I have served as the guest editor (with Mark Livingston at NRL) of a &#8220;Mixed Reality&#8221; special issue of <a title="http://www.computer.org/cga/" href="http://www.computer.org/cga/">IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications</a>.</p>
	
    
# Consulting
    
In 2008, I co-founded Aura Interactive to design and build Augmented Reality Games, and co-lead the company through 2014.  In 2015, I co-founded a new company, the _MacMynatt Group_, focused on the intersection of Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, and Interactive Environments.

Over the years, I&#8217;ve had extensive experience in the design and implementation of interactive augmented and mixed reality experiences, from games and toys to tours of historic sites and advertising applications.  I&#8217;ve worked on experiences on kiosks, room-sized installations, experimental designs using head-worn displays, and mobile systems on a range of platforms and operating systems.  My team has also released handheld Augmented Reality games and applications on Android and iOS.

Over the years, I have worked with dozens of companies, large and small,  as a professor and consultant.  I&#8217;ve consulted with mobile technology, media, games and interactive design companies. Leveraging my long experience with augmented reality, mixed reality and mobile computing, I am happy to discuss short or long term consulting, and am also available for more specialized services, including expert witness consulting.
