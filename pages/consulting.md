In 2008, I co-founded Aura Interactive to design and build Augmented Reality Games, and co-lead the company through 2014.  In 2015, I co-founded a new company, the _MacMynatt Group_, focused on the intersection of Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, and Interactive Environments.

Over the years, I&#8217;ve had extensive experience in the design and implementation of interactive augmented and mixed reality experiences, from games and toys to tours of historic sites and advertising applications.  I&#8217;ve worked on experiences on kiosks, room-sized installations, experimental designs using head-worn displays, and mobile systems on a range of platforms and operating systems.  My team has also released handheld Augmented Reality games and applications on Android and iOS.

Over the years, I have worked with dozens of companies, large and small,  as a professor and consultant.  I&#8217;ve consulted with mobile technology, media, games and interactive design companies. Leveraging my long experience with augmented reality, mixed reality and mobile computing, I am happy to discuss short or long term consulting, and am also available for more specialized services, including expert witness consulting.
