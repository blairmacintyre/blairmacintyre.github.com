In 2008, I co-founded an AR gaming and media company called [Aura Interactive](http://aurainterface.com) to design and build Augmented Reality Games, and co-lead the company through 2014.  

In 2015, I co-founded a consulting company, the _MacMynatt Group_{% sidenote 'mmg-contact' 'You can contact me at _blair@macmynattgroup.com_.' %}, focused on the intersection of Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, and Interactive Environments.

{% newthought "Over the years" %}, I've had extensive experience in the design and implementation of interactive augmented and mixed reality experiences, from games and toys to tours of historic sites and advertising applications.  I've worked on experiences on kiosks, room-sized installations, experimental designs using head-worn displays, and mobile systems on a range of platforms and operating systems.  My team has also released handheld Augmented Reality games and applications on Android and iOS.

I have worked with dozens of companies, large and small,  as a professor and consultant.  I've consulted with mobile technology, media, games and interactive design companies. Leveraging my long experience with augmented reality, mixed reality and mobile computing, I am happy to discuss short or long term consulting, and am also available for more specialized services, including expert witness consulting.
